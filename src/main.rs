As of kernel version 4.14.34, released on April 16 2018, it's possible to configure your Raspberry Pi to allow non-root access to PWM. 
4.14.34 includes a patch that allows udev to change file permissions when a PWM channel is exported. 
This will let any user that is a member of the GPIO group configure PWM without having to use sudo.

The udev rules needed to make this work haven't been patched in yet as of June 2018, but you can easily add them yourself. 
Make sure you're running 4.14.34 or later, and append the following snippet to /etc/udev/rules.d/99-com.rules. Reboot the Raspberry Pi afterwards.
