As of kernel version 4.14.34, released on April 16 2018, it's possible to configure your Raspberry Pi to allow non-root access to PWM. 
4.14.34 includes a patch that allows udev to change file permissions when a PWM channel is exported. 
This will let any user that is a member of the GPIO group configure PWM without having to use sudo.

The udev rules needed to make this work haven't been patched in yet as of June 2018, but you can easily add them yourself. 
Make sure you're running 4.14.34 or later, and append the following snippet to /etc/udev/rules.d/99-com.rules. Reboot the Raspberry Pi afterwards.

```
SUBSYSTEM=="pwm*", PROGRAM="/bin/sh -c '\
    chown -R root:gpio /sys/class/pwm && chmod -R 770 /sys/class/pwm;\
    chown -R root:gpio /sys/devices/platform/soc/*.pwm/pwm/pwmchip* &&\
    chmod -R 770 /sys/devices/platform/soc/*.pwm/pwm/pwmchip*\
'"
```

const PERMISSION_ERROR: &str = r#"
By default, both channels are disabled.

To enable only PWM0 on its default pin (BCM GPIO 18, physical pin 12), add dtoverlay=pwm to /boot/config.txt on Raspberry Pi OS or boot/firmware/usercfg.txt on Ubuntu.
If you need both PWM channels, replace pwm with pwm-2chan, which enables PWM0 on BCM GPIO 18 (physical pin 12), and PWM1 on BCM GPIO 19 (physical pin 35).
More details on enabling and configuring PWM on other GPIO pins than the default ones can be found in /boot/overlays/README.
